TODO:
MUST DO:
- add at least one video and build the css around it to make the show page look great

NICE TO HAVE:
- add analytics, including some event so we can track number of broadcasts created without having to keep them in the db forever
- make a cute pdf they can print out and put on the fridge?
- build an actual design
- preview the tv when you're making a broadcast
- create a more helpful 404 page
